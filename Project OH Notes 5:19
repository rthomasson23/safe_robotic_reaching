Project OH Notes 5/19

Optimization problem
	take a min with zero to avoid reward with moving far away from obstacles

Criteria to decide whether to resolve SQP
	obstacle immovable
		resolve SQP with updated cost
	obstacle movable
		don't need to resolve SQP


Regularize eqn 2
	norm of Q - Q_terminal
		norm 2: try harder earlier
		norm 1: all penalized equally

OR

Penalize contorl input



Feasiblity
	add terminal constraint to the path

How do we wanna do motion planning (experimental data?)
	pretend no obstacles
	pretend fixed obstacles

The BUG algorithm
	motion planning
		drives to goal
		responds when you hit something

Project yourself onto the closest place on the spline
	Apply the control
	Maybe use lqr tracking
	Nathaniel: Use PID to address Terminal error? (would not use lqr in this case)

Replan if the control is zero?
